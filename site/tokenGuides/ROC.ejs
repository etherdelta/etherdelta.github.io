<blockquote>
  <p>RasputinOnline is a premium live broadcast Entertainment hub giving viewers from across the globe the medium to connect with our in-house models on different levels. Our fresh concept in entertainment for adults is centred around our custom-built broadcast studio which is set out as a party house, in this party house will live 60 models all coming from different parts of the world. Throughout the house there will be up to 100 cameras streaming life inside live, in High Definition, 24 hours per day. Cameras will be placed in all living areas, party and bar areas, swimming pool, gym and spa areas, the outdoor kitchen and hot tub area and in the bedrooms and bathrooms all of which broadcast live pictures and audio to our paying customers. Within the house we will also have up to 30 Live Show rooms. These live show rooms are private rooms where our models perform on camera broadcast to a live audience. Viewers can chat in an open chat room and tip the model at anytime or they can engage in a private show with the model. It is the profit derived from these Live Show rooms that will be distributed quarterly to ROC token holders. Members can vote on what type of weekly party will take place in the house, they can choose for their favourite model to take yoga classes, painting or piano lessons, they can buy roses, perfume and other gifts or they can send their favourite model a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates allowing our members to interact with our models in many different ways. Virtual reality will be implemented at a future stage which will give the user the option to walk through the house and experience life inside in an immersive way all from their own home.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethereum Alps with ticker "EALP" is an open source peer-to-peer and business-to-customer decentralised digital currency, which unlike those of traditional banks and financial institutions is viewable and easily audited by anyone. The blockchain of Ethereum Alps offers secure, instant, decentralised and private transactions. EALP token is fully ERC20-compliant, ensuring that it is supported by all major wallets and exchanges. The main idea behind creating our project is to have Ethereum Alps accepted as a payment digital currency in the top-rated Alpine touristic sites in all the Alpine states: France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, Monaco, Liechtenstein, and Slovenia. The Alps are the largest mountain chain in Europe, extending for almost 1,000 km. The Alps are the ideal destination for a whole host of leisure and outdoor activities &ndash; skiing, hiking, mountaineering, white water rafting, pot-holing, mountain biking, visiting thermal baths and much more besides!. With about 375 million overnight stays per year, the Alps count as one of the most tourism-intense regions in the world, situated in a geographically and climatically perfect environment. â€¨Our long-term goal is not only to have Ethereum Alps widely accepted and adopted in the Alpine region, but also to create a new union gathering all the Alpine states around a new innovative project in which Ethereum Alps is the major player.</p>

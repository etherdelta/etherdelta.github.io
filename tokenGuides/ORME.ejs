<blockquote>
  <p>The real-world value of this new token is secured and cryptographically linked to a publicly verifiable reserve of Bitcoin - the &lsquo;gold standard&rsquo; of cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin reserve known as the Ormeus Reserve Vault (hereafter &ldquo;ORV&rdquo;) is a multisignature Bitcoin wallet funded by the ongoing industrial Bitcoin mining operations of Ormeus Global. These operations have an initial baseline hashing power of 30 PH/s. This hashrate will be continuously upgraded by allocating proceeds derived from the sale of ORME tokens. Unlike other static (or semi-static) Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrencies (which are historically highly speculative in nature and backed by token sales alone) Ormeus Coin will be backed both by token sales and a geographically diverse industrial cryptocurrency mining operation. This predefined mechanism to facilitate the continual accumulation of hashing power will result in the ORV having a constantly increasing reserve store of Bitcoin which effectively distinguishes ORME as a stable store-of-value.</p>

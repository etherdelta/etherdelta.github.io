This is the repository for EtherDelta, https://www.etherdelta.com.

EtherDelta is an exchange which trades ERC20 tokens and does so, almost exclusively, on-chain. It does not provide any sort of order matchmaking. As such, bids and asks may overlap on the orderbook momentarily. This is not considered an issue.

You may find information on how to build bots to interact with EtherDelta in the /bots subdirectory.

EtherDelta is not licensed for reuse. This code being viewable on GitHub is only for informational purposes, for helping you build bots, and for communicating issues to developers. You are not licensed to re-use any code, other than what is found in /bots, for your own purposes. Additionally, the deployed JS files are intentionally minified for obfuscation. The server-side logic of EtherDelta is not open-source and is proprietary.

Thanks. Enjoy!
